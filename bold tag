        <h2> My Favorite Book </h2>
        <p>
            Favourite book is the one which is liked the most. Different people have different choice. 
            Some like <b>story books</b>, other like the <b>detective movies</b> and the other like <b>science fiction</b> but I have different mind. 
            I do not have any other favourite book of those. I like the “Holy Quran” the most. It is a heavenly book. 
            The <b>Holy Quran </b> revealed to the <b>Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him)</b>. It is in Arabic language.
        </p>
            <p>
            The Holy Quran is my favourite book because I get satisfaction after reciting it. 
            Every morning I love to recite the Holy Quran. I recite it with its <b>“Urdu” </b> 
            There is a lot of information in it. Every Muslim has a <b>firm </b> in it. It tells us about this life and the life hereafter.</p>
            <p>
            The Holy Quran is a complete <b>code of life</b>. One can find a solution to every problem. It not only deals 
            with the worldly affairs but also with affairs of the world hereafter. It gives us a complete guidance.
            There are clear injunctions about our life in the Holy Quran. Every aspect of our life has been
            discussed in detail in it. That is why all the Muslims cannot go <b>against</b> its teachings.
            </p>
            <p>
            In short, the Holy Quran is not an <b>individual's or nations'</b> book but also for the whole universe.
